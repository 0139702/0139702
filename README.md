## 🌻 Hi, I'm Sonnig

I'm someone who sits at the intersection of **computer graphics, interaction, and design**.

I enjoy exploring how visuals are generated, stylized, and experienced —
sometimes through code, sometimes through design tools, and often through
interactive systems like games or creative prototypes.

---

## 🧬 Core Interest: Computer Graphics

My main area of interest is **Computer Graphics**.

I'm fascinated by graphics not just as images, but as systems:
rendering pipelines, shading, real-time constraints, and the expressive
possibilities that emerge when visuals meet interaction.

---

## ⚡ What I Enjoy Exploring

- Computer Graphics fundamentals  
- Stylized Rendering (cartoon, artistic, non-photorealistic styles)  
- Game development
- Interactive art & creative coding
- UI/UX design informed by technical understanding

---

## 🌱 How I'm Growing

I'm gradually exploring paths related to:

- Graphics engineering & real-time rendering
- Technical art and graphics-oriented tooling
- Research directions in stylized and expressive graphics
- Applying graphics concepts to games and interactive systems

I don't see these as separate roles, but as connected ways of working
with computer graphics from different perspectives.
